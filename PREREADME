##Core Classes and Structure:

SimAction: Base class for actions in the simulation, handling the execution and completion of different actions like moving, interacting, or waiting.
GoTo, Interact, ConverseWith, Wait, Reflect: Subclasses of SimAction, each tailored to handle specific types of actions within the simulation.
SimAgent: Represents characters in the simulation, with properties like persona, location, skills, and memories. This class manages the actions of each agent and their interactions with the environment.

##Simulation Mechanics:

Each agent in the simulation (SimAgent) can perform actions (like moving to a location or interacting with an object), which are processed in real-time using async functions.
Actions are influenced by the agent's current state, skills, and memories, making the narrative dynamic and responsive.
The simulation's timeline advances with each tick, allowing for the progression of events and interactions.

##Narrative Generation and Interaction:

The Simulation class orchestrates the entire simulation environment, managing time progression, agents, locations, objects, and conversation generation.
Agents can generate and choose from a list of actions based on their current context, facilitated by the ActionGenerator class.
The ConversationGenerator enables agents to have simulated conversations, contributing to the narrative's depth and development.

##Advanced Features:

The simulation employs a language model (likely an AI like GPT-3) for generating rich and contextually appropriate conversations and actions.
It features a reflective design that allows narratives to evolve based on agent interactions, user feedback, and predefined philosophical and cultural themes.
Agents' memories play a crucial role, influencing their decisions and interactions, reflecting a dynamic narrative ecosystem.
